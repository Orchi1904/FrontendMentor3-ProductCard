## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It was pretty similar to the QR code challenge (my first challenge), except that this challenge had to be responsive. So it was nice to review how to use media queries again. It is funny that I used ```text-decoration: line-through;``` for the first time because I`d never had to use it before :) I had to use it here to cross out the old price in the Product Card. 

Also, this time I finished the project one hour earlier than expected because I had nearly no problems, unlike my last project where I had some troubles with the JSON file icons.
